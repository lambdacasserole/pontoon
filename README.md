# Pontoon

Pontoon is a simple and straightforward tool for running deploy scripts from a web service. When it comes to getting my
latest changes online, I yearn for something simple. One button click should be all it takes or I start laughing like a
maniac and talking to my cup of coffee.

## Aaahhhhh! F**k!

If that's how you sound at the moment when a client asks you to make a minor, 5-second content change that's gonna end
up taking you half an hour by the time you've found your SSH keys, loaded them into your client, connected and run all
your deployment stuff then do yourself a favour and grab Pontoon.
